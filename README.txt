Description
-----------

The Message Queue plugin has been developed by Kevin Jardine originally. It's a utility plugin that supplies message queuing services to other plugins. This enables emails to be sent via cron jobs, i.e. sending them at a defined later time. For example the Event Calendar plugin makes use of the Message Queue plugin for (optionally) sending of reminders messages shortly before the event is to start.

For the Message Queue plugin to work you need to have the Elgg fiveminute cronjob correctly configured.
